Hickory Dickory Dock
A mouse ran up his clock
The clock struck one
Down the mouse did run
Hickory Dickory Dock

Hickory Dickory Dock
He got into a fight with a jock
Bartender threw them out as the clock struck two
The jock said "You stepped on my blue shoe!"
Hickory Dickory Dock

Hickory Dickory Dock
The cat chased a mouse down the block
The clock banged loudly to three
His hand on head, down on one knee
Hickory Dickory Dock

Hickory Dickory Dock
He needs a new bedroom clock
The alarm rang out at four
He threw it against the bedroom door
Hickory Dickory Dock

Hickory Dickory Dock
Gun in hand, shot the big red cock
Cuckoo clock says it's now five
If Big Red didn't crow, he'd still be alive
Hickory Dickory Dock

Hickory Dickory Dock
Alarm strikes 6 o'clock
Into the shower
At this damn hour
Hickory Dickory Dock
